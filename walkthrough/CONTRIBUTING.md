Issues & discussions
--------------------

You can open an issue or discussion for virtually anything you want:

- Report typos or other mistakes.
- Ask me a question.
- Discuss about an existing or alternative solution.
- Propose a change or improvement.


Pull Requests
-------------

Please do *not* submit pull requests for:

- Changes to original solutions: I only keep those as a snapshot of the first
  solution I wrote when solving the puzzles. They are not really supposed to be
  changed, and definitely *not* supposed to be clean, optimal or even correct. I
  only update those if I update some of the used utiliy functions just to keep
  them at least runnable.

- Changes to clean solutions and walkthrougs: the choices I make for clean
  solutions are mostly documented in my walkthroughs. If you think that
  something is off, or that some improvement is possible, you are most welcome
  to [open an issue][new-issue] or [start a discussion][new-discussion] to tell
  me about it. I prefer this because (1) it's less work for you, (2) I need to
  understand and adapt the suggestion before even thinking of applying it, (3)
  I will also have to adapt the walkthrough at the same time, and finally (4) I
  might change mind about the license that I am using for my work in the future.

- Grammatical errors, typos, phrasing mistakes in walkthrougs:
  please, [open an issue][new-issue] instead. I update the repository
  walkthrougs constantly, and keep track of things that need to get fixed in a
  private list. Therefore, there is a high chance that I already spotted the
  problem by myself, and since I try to keep "fix typo" commits to a minimum, I
  am just waiting to do a single commit with a batch of fixes.

Feel free to open pull requests for:

- Adding new solutions derived from mine: different approaches, alternative
  solutions using interesting external libraries, etc. If you do, put those
  under an appropriate folder: `YEAR/misc/dayXX/` and use meaningful file names.

- Editing/fixing/improving anything under the `YEAR/misc/` folders that is not a
  solution: scripts for visualizations, the script used to fetch leaderboards,
  etc.

- Editing/fixing/improving anything outside the different year's folders:
  utilities, documentation (including this document), and so on.
